A good deed is never lost.
The darkest hour is that before the dawn
You reap what you sow
When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.
Don't boast of tomorrow, for you know not what a day will bring.
A good name keeps its lustre in the dark
As the twig is bent, so shall the tree grow
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire
A stitch in time saves nine
All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes
A guilty conscience needs no accuser
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely
He who denies all confesses all
In the way of righteousness there is life
If you play with fire, you’ll get burned
The grass is always greener on the other side
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest
A good example is the best sermon
A tree is known by its fruit
Actions speak louder than words
Fortune favours the bold
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
He that cannot obey, cannot command
A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
Say little and do much
First mend yourself, then mend others
Ten enemies can not do the harm a man can do to himself
A good deed is never lost.
